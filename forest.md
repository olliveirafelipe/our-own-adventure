# The Mysterious Forest

You step into the forest, where tall trees block most of the sunlight. The air is cool and damp, and every step you take crunches against fallen leaves.

A ring of stones peeks through the moss to your leftâ€”too round to be natural. Farther ahead, the faint sound of running water calls from deeper in the trees.

What will you do?
