# The Mysterious Forest

You step into the forest, where tall trees block most of the sunlight. The air is cool and damp, and every step you take crunches against fallen leaves.  

Suddenly, you hear the faint sound of running water in the distance. On the other side, you notice a narrow trail that looks like it has been walked before.  

What will you do?
