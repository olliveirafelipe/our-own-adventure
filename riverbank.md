# The Riverbank

The girl moves cautiously through the trees, drawn by the steady sound of rushing water.

Branches scrape her arms as she pushes through the underbrush, but soon she breaks into a clearing. Before her flows a wide, fast-moving river, silver in the moonlight.

She kneels by the edge, catching her breath. The water seems to shimmer strangely, reflecting not her face—but someone else's.

Startled, she stumbles back, and the image vanishes.

A broken bridge crosses the river to the left. To the right, the shoreline winds deeper into darkness.

She must decide quickly—something is watching from the trees.

What will she do?
