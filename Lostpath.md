# The Lost Path: A Journey Through Shadows

You wake up in a dark, unfamiliar forest.  
The air is cold, and the trees whisper as if they’re alive.  
A faint glow flickers in the distance, while behind you, you hear the sound of rushing water.  

Your heart races. You know you must make a choice—your survival depends on it.  

What will you do next?

The shadows seem to twist strangely, making it hard to tell where the path begins.
