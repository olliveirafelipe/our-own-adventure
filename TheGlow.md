# Investigate the Glow

You step carefully toward the glow, branches crunching underfoot. The light wavers, as though it’s carried by someone—or something. A sudden breeze makes the lantern flicker, and you hear faint footsteps just ahead.

## Choices

1. **Call out, hoping it’s another traveler.**  
2. **Stay silent and follow the footsteps.**
