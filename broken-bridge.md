ðŸŒ‰ The Broken Bridge

The girl edges toward the crumbling bridge, each footstep on the damp earth louder than it should be.

The planks groan under her weight as she steps onto the bridge. Some boards are missing entirelyâ€”below, the river churns like a living thing, hungry and cold.

Halfway across, a sudden gust of wind howls through the trees behind her.
She doesnâ€™t look back. She canâ€™t.

Just as she reaches the other side, a sharp snap echoes behind herâ€”the bridge gives way.

She scrambles onto the far bank, heart pounding. The bridge is gone.

Ahead, the forest changes. The trees are older here, taller, their bark blackened as if scorched. A narrow trail winds forward, marked with strange, glowing symbols carved into stone.

Something ancient waits ahead.
