The House on Ashwood Lane

Halloween night. A cold rain slicks the pavement as you and your friends stand before the old Ashwood house.  
Legend says the place swallowed a whole family one Octoberâ€”no bodies were ever found.  
The front door is cracked open, and a faint candle flickers inside.

Do you dare to step in?
